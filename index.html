  <h2>Getting through it-<em>how to bribe your friends with food and drink to help paint</em> </h2>

  <p>Whilst painting your home, help is, well, <em>helpful</em>. <br> So, here are some tips on getting your friends to help with the awful task of painting before they really know what they're getting into:</p>

    <ul>
      <li>Bribe with booze and pizza</li>
      <li>Talk about how fun it will be</li>
      <li>Lie about the amount of time you need their help and be sure to remove clocks and phones to remove evidence of time.</li>
    </ul>
